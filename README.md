Non-Profit Theater Website
This project is a modern front-end rebuild of a non-profit theater website, designed to improve usability, accessibility, and visual consistency while remaining easy to maintain by a volunteer or small technical team. The site is implemented as a React + TypeScript single-page application using Vite for fast development and builds.
 The UI layer is built with reusable, accessible components to support future expansion events, auditions, archives, donations, etc.
This site is still a work in progress. 

Tech stack so far:
React with TypeScript
Vite (build tool & dev server)
Shadcn / Radix-style UI components
CSS (global styles in index.css)
